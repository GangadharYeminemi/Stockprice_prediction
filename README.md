This project focuses on predicting stock prices by leveraging an ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. LGBM, a tree-based gradient boosting algorithm, excels in capturing non-linear patterns in tabular data, while GRU, a recurrent neural network, effectively models temporal dependencies in time-series stock data. By combining these models, the ensemble approach enhances prediction accuracy and robustness. Historical stock data, including features like closing prices, volume, and technical indicators, is preprocessed and fed into the models. The ensemble's predictions are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE or MAE, demonstrating improved performance over individual models. This project showcases the power of hybrid machine learning and deep learning techniques for financial forecasting.
